# Vibration-detection-using-binocular-vision

This project, aimed at detecting the vibration of flexible joint, is founded on MATLAB software, targeted at Quanser rotary flexible joint, dependent on binocular vision, and implemented by the thought of mathematical morphology method. Firstly, we got both intrinsic and extrinsic parameters of the cameras by stereo calibration. Then we designed and tested the algorithm using mathematical morphology method. To better analyze the data from image processing procedure and to assess its validity, this train of data is compared with another string of statistics from the sensors mounted in the system. Lastly, we applied wavelet analysis to ameliorate the results.

Excuse the "report.pdf" file, it's a detailed version of this project but it's in Chinese.
